## ✨ Key Features

* **🧠 Intelligent Classification:** Powered by the robust **TensorFlow (Keras)** `MobileNetV2` model for fast and accurate predictions.
* **🎨 True Apple HIG Design:** The UI isn't just "inspired" by Apple; it's built on the core principles of the Human Interface Guidelines.
    * **Semantic Colors:** Red for destructive, Green for primary actions.
    * **Hierarchical Layout:** Layered backgrounds create depth and focus.
    * **Light & Dark Modes:** Fully adaptive themes for any environment.
* **🌍 Fully Internationalized (i18n):** Supports 7 languages out of the box, with a scalable architecture that makes adding more a breeze. All translations are managed in external `.json` files.
* **⚡ Dynamic & Responsive UI:**
    * The layout intelligently **hides the large image and shows a thumbnail** after analysis to focus on the results.
    * **Custom-built, fully-rounded buttons** and interactive, hover-able result rows provide a premium feel.
* **🔗 Deep Wikipedia Integration:** Go beyond identification. Instantly fetch and display summaries for any prediction with a single click, turning the app into a learning tool.
* **🚀 High-Performance Architecture:**
    * The UI launches instantly while the heavy AI model loads in a separate thread.
    * The codebase is professionally refactored into `app.py` (UI), `core.py` (Engine), and `utils.py` (Toolbox) for maximum maintainability.
